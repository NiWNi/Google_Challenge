                <p>The inland taipan may be the world’s most venomous snake, but this Australian taipan is so shy that hardly anything was known about it by Western science for nearly a hundred years after it was first described in 1879.</p>
                <p class="quote">A new species is ‘described’ after it has been discovered. Describing a species means giving it a name and telling the scientific world that the new species exists (i.e. ‘describing’ the characteristics of the new species and how it differs from existing species).</p>
                <p>The inland taipan’s alternative name, ‘fierce snake’, points to the potency of its venom rather than its behaviour. The other Australian taipan that it shares a common ancestor with, namely the coastal taipan, is far more aggressive.</p>
